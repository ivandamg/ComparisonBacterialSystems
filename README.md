Analysis of different bacterials systems like the Type VI secretion system. Between two strains. 


1. Identify the complete gene list of the system.

2. Blast those genes in two strains.


3. Extract coordinates of the genes in the genome assemblies


4. Curate manually the coordinates and size of the genes.
